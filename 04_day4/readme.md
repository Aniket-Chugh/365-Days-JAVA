# day 4: we learnt :
how to make funtions in java and methods in java and how to call funtion and how 
good it is...

to make meathods.

3. we learnt about Halting Condition


halting condition :-  recursive functions can run into the problem of infinite recursion.
Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself. Every recursive function should have a halting condition, 
which is the condition where the function stops calling itself. 

Java Recursion---
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. 

Method Overloading --
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters.


Java Scope --
In Java, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. This is called scope.

 Method Scope --
Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method

Block Scope --
A block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces {}.
